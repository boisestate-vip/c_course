# Work

I think it would be useful if you got some
practice with these concepts outside of
the 'class'. So I have put together some
sample functions to write that will be a
bit challenging but should be rewarding because
they will get you reasoning with the logic
and sort of having a good grasp of the 
fundamentals.    
    
I will note that it is important to really
understand the small stuff like this. Everything
else is built on it, so if you breeze through
it you will end up suffering a bit when things
actually get complex...    
     
Next week I will be taking everything I said
here for granted, so you try and commit all
this to memory if you don't want to be lost
going forward...

# Format

Every file has an outline and a comment
string for what is expected. I will post
solutions for one file every day after
the lesson. These are going to require some
thought, and will be a bit challenging, so
don't worry if you can't get them...
