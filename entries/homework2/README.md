# 2nd homework

These homeworks are designed to be more agressive
I guess and force you to have a better understanding 
of C and using it to accomplish various tasks.    
     
I will provide a reccommended order below:

 * array
 * files
 * macros
 * set
 * strbuf
 * skiplist
 * int128
 * generic array

 You of course don't have to follow it :)
