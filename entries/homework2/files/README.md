# files

file manipulation in C is actually
pretty powerful, at least to me.
They are easier to use than a lot
of other languages *cough* *cough*
java *cough*     
      
This is just going to be a bit of playing
around and doing some fun (i think) stuff.    

Read over the start of the file, then run
it. After that do the work to reimpliment
fload by reading the fseek and ftell
commands. Again, you should start to see
the file as just another array :)
