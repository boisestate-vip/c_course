# array

Arrays are kind of a staple
data class in C. Other languages
are nice to us and give us these
dynamic lists that grow as we put
elements into them. C is not as nice
and forces us to manage all that
ourselves if we want to.

I will provide a header and some
notes for most of these. I will
also try and provide a main.c
file that you can use to test.
